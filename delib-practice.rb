# Choose a deliberate practice problem to work on.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

# Start with an array of strings and create a new array with each string's first letter only.
# For example, ["hello", "goodbye"] becomes ["h", "g"].
array = ["hello", "goodbye"]
letters1 = array[0].split(//)
letters2 = array[1].split(//)
array2 = [letters1[0], letters2[0]]
pp array2

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# I was able to solve this problem from memory.
# The next skill I will start to practice tomrrow is:
# Start with an array of hashes and create a new array of number values from each hash's :age key times 2.
# For example, [{name: "Alice", age: 27}, {name: "Blane", age: 16}] becomes [54, 32].
